# Browser Vs NodeJs Environments

This is a brief highlight about the differences of the browser environment and the NodeJs environment when running Javascript code.


## How to use
Clone the project to your PC. Ensure NodeJs is installed.

In the index.js file uncomment the line of code you wish to run.
Specifically, any console.log line.

Open the terminal in the project folder that you cloned and run 
```
node index.js
```
The output of the above command will give you information about the object you are trying to access.
